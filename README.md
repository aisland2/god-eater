# God Eater 2: Rage Burst Review!
God Eater 2: Rage Burst is a game developed by Shift and published by Namco Bandai Games that can be played on the Playstation 4, PS Vita, and Steam. The basics of the game is you as a God Eater, go out in groups of four and face monsters called "Aragami" to rid them from your base as you attempt to figure out how to keep them from destroying your world.

Despite having fun with the game, many of the features with it needed serious testing to be more efficient. Some minor things with the game I wish they tested more is the players model, which always stands in a normal pose and can't be changed. Another mechanic that ties in with the character model: The sound and music. For some reason the music doesn't loop properly, and tends to fade out and stop playing outright for no reason while with the character, it only makes a sound when the character's right foot hits the footing twice, which is very unrealistic. In the field of battle, the AI for both the enemy and ally team can tend to be a little offsetting, being a bit unsure when faced against each other, then fighting like their life depends on it the next. I feel like there's something it could do a bit better.

These are just a few of the functions that could be tested for God Eater 2.
